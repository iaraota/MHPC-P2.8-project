o compile WITH the cmake file do the following:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
Then, the executable will be create;then, if you want remove all the file.o and the executable do:
```bash
make clean

```
If you want check the result, you should do 

```bash
make check
```
The corrected result should print **"The argon_# simulation was executed without errors."**

# Enjoy, if you can!
